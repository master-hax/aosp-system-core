      "message": "I read https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/100661/, but at least what I saw in ch9.h looks OK and works as far as I can tell.\nMaybe I am mistaken but \"usb_linux.c\" looks like it actually uses the linux kernel headers of your system directly (\"linux/usb/ch9.h\"). So if you have a recent kernel (with USB 3.0 support), you also get the right definitions from your kernel headers of your system, as far as I can tell.",

Can we please get this merged?\n\nAlso, I would like to propose a similar fix to fastboot/usb_linux.c as well. I can submit another change to Gerrit for that.",
