Of course, it\u0027s unsafe in generaly to call \u0027delete ret\u0027. You must call \u0027ret-\u003edecStrong()\u0027 because there may be something else that owns it. Or were you thinking something else?\n\nDo you have the case where you want to use this, so I can see what you mean? I can see how this API would be useful, but it\u0027s also probably better to avoid managing ownership like this.",

Also, if you use this API, you\u0027ll no longer have matching \u0027incStrong\u0027 and \u0027decStrong\u0027, which I honestly see as the biggest clarity issue - you have to know you are pairing decStrong with incStrong in the constructor.\n\nDo you think there\u0027s some other more explicit name we could use? I think the code I quoted above with incStrong and make is probably better than a shortcut - fewer things to think about at the cost of a few lines of code, but if you feel strongly about adding this API, I think it needs more docs, bigger name to distinguish it from \u0027release\u0027, and maybe add a test as well?\n\nbut yeah, I am not convinced we should encourage this type of thing, as necessary as it is.
