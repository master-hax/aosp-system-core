      "message": "What do you mean \"out of line\" ?  That we\u0027re calling through function pointers instead of directly?\n\nThere\u0027s a static set of liblog_functions in liblog_symbols.cpp, so the first call to GetLiblogFunctions() is responsible for the dlopen() / dlsym() and subsequent calls just retrieve the result.  statics and their initializers are thread safe with C++11, so this \"just works\".  It returns a reference to the std::optional, so no deep copies needed.  \n\nEssentially in any of these functions (after the first time) we have :\n1) A function call to GetLibLogFunctions()\n2) An atomic load to check that our static has been initialized\n3) A return of the reference to the std::optional\u003cLibLogFunctions\u003e\n4) A call through the function pointer inside the std::optional\u003cLibLogFunctions\u003e.\n\nIt\u0027s not that heavy.  I could move the static std::optional\u003cLibLogFunctions\u003e into logging.cpp though to save on the function call overhead, but I assume that isn\u0027t much.",
