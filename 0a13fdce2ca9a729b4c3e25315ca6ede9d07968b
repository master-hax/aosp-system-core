      "message": "nit: Could you provide more details on the commit message. I see that the bug mentions that there was a buffer overflow, and your analysis was:\n\n\"The overflow happens in fdevent.cpp, fdevent_update: FD_SET(fde-\u003efd, \u0026read_fds).\nso I think it is because the fd number is out of range of fd_set, namely there are more files opened than we expected.\"\n\nBut moving to polling seems like a big change for that. So many you could explain if that was the sole reason to this rearchitecture, and if there are any performance impacts due to this.",
