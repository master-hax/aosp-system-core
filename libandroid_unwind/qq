DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       mmssggccttll()  performs the control operation specified by _c_m_d on the System
       V message queue with identifier _m_s_q_i_d.

       The _m_s_q_i_d___d_s data structure is defined in _<_s_y_s_/_m_s_g_._h_> as follows:

           struct msqid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm msg_perm;     /* Ownership and permissions */
               time_t          msg_stime;    /* Time of last msgsnd(2) */
               time_t          msg_rtime;    /* Time of last msgrcv(2) */
               time_t          msg_ctime;    /* Time of last change */
               unsigned long   __msg_cbytes; /* Current number of bytes in
                                                queue (nonstandard) */
               msgqnum_t       msg_qnum;     /* Current number of messages
                                                in queue */
               msglen_t        msg_qbytes;   /* Maximum number of bytes
                                                allowed in queue */
               pid_t           msg_lspid;    /* PID of last msgsnd(2) */
               pid_t           msg_lrpid;    /* PID of last msgrcv(2) */
           };

       The _i_p_c___p_e_r_m structure is defined as follows  (the  highlighted  fields
       are settable using IIPPCC__SSEETT):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key;       /* Key supplied to msgget(2) */
               uid_t          uuiidd;         /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          ggiidd;         /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;        /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;        /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short mmooddee;        /* Permissions */
               unsigned short __seq;       /* Sequence number */
           };

       Valid values for _c_m_d are:

       IIPPCC__SSTTAATT
              Copy  information from the kernel data structure associated with
              _m_s_q_i_d into the _m_s_q_i_d___d_s structure pointed to by _b_u_f.  The caller
              must have read permission on the message queue.

       IIPPCC__SSEETT
              Write  the  values  of  some  members  of the _m_s_q_i_d___d_s structure
              pointed to by _b_u_f to the kernel data structure  associated  with
              this  message  queue,  updating  also its _m_s_g___c_t_i_m_e member.  The
              following members of  the  structure  are  updated:  _m_s_g___q_b_y_t_e_s,
              _m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d,  _m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._g_i_d,  and  (the least significant 9 bits
              of) _m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._m_o_d_e.  The effective UID  of  the  calling  process
              must  match  the owner (_m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d) or creator (_m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._c_u_i_d)
              of the message queue, or the caller must be privileged.   Appro‐
              priate  privilege  (Linux:  the  CCAAPP__IIPPCC__RREESSOOUURRCCEE capability) is
              required to raise the _m_s_g___q_b_y_t_e_s value beyond the system parame‐
              ter MMSSGGMMNNBB.

       IIPPCC__RRMMIIDD
              Immediately  remove  the  message  queue,  awakening all waiting
              reader and writer processes (with an error return and _e_r_r_n_o  set
              to EEIIDDRRMM).  The calling process must have appropriate privileges
              or its effective user ID must be either that of the  creator  or
              owner of the message queue.

       IIPPCC__IINNFFOO (Linux-specific)
              Returns  information  about system-wide message queue limits and
              parameters in the structure pointed to by _b_u_f.   This  structure
              is  of  type  _m_s_g_i_n_f_o  (thus,  a  cast  is required), defined in
              _<_s_y_s_/_m_s_g_._h_> if the __GGNNUU__SSOOUURRCCEE feature test macro is defined:

                  struct msginfo {
                      int msgpool; /* Size in kibibytes of buffer pool
                                      used to hold message data;
                                      unused within kernel */
                      int msgmap;  /* Maximum number of entries in message
                                      map; unused within kernel */
                      int msgmax;  /* Maximum number of bytes that can be
                                      written in a single message */
                      int msgmnb;  /* Maximum number of bytes that can be
                                      written to queue; used to initialize
                                      msg_qbytes during queue creation
                                      (msgget(2)) */
                      int msgmni;  /* Maximum number of message queues */
                      int msgssz;  /* Message segment size;
                                      unused within kernel */
                      int msgtql;  /* Maximum number of messages on all queues
                                      in system; unused within kernel */
                      unsigned short int msgseg;
                                   /* Maximum number of segments;
                                      unused within kernel */
                  };

              The _m_s_g_m_n_i, _m_s_g_m_a_x, and _m_s_g_m_n_b settings can be changed via _/_p_r_o_c
              files of the same name; see pprroocc(5) for details.

       MMSSGG__IINNFFOO (Linux-specific)
              Returns  a  _m_s_g_i_n_f_o structure containing the same information as
              for IIPPCC__IINNFFOO, except that the following fields are returned with
              information  about  system resources consumed by message queues:
              the _m_s_g_p_o_o_l field returns the number of message queues that cur‐
              rently  exist  on the system; the _m_s_g_m_a_p field returns the total
              number of messages in all queues on the system; and  the  _m_s_g_t_q_l
              field  returns  the total number of bytes in all messages in all
              queues on the system.

       MMSSGG__SSTTAATT (Linux-specific)
              Returns a _m_s_q_i_d___d_s structure  as  for  IIPPCC__SSTTAATT.   However,  the
              _m_s_q_i_d  argument  is not a queue identifier, but instead an index
              into the kernel's  internal  array  that  maintains  information
              about all message queues on the system.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       On  success,  IIPPCC__SSTTAATT,  IIPPCC__SSEETT,  and IIPPCC__RRMMIIDD return 0.  A successful
       IIPPCC__IINNFFOO or MMSSGG__IINNFFOO operation returns the index of  the  highest  used
       entry  in  the  kernel's internal array recording information about all
       message queues.  (This information can be used with  repeated  MMSSGG__SSTTAATT
       operations  to  obtain  information about all queues on the system.)  A
       successful MMSSGG__SSTTAATT operation returns the identifier of the queue whose
       index was given in _m_s_q_i_d.

       On error, -1 is returned with _e_r_r_n_o indicating the error.

EERRRROORRSS
       On failure, _e_r_r_n_o is set to one of the following:

       EEAACCCCEESS The argument _c_m_d is equal to IIPPCC__SSTTAATT or MMSSGG__SSTTAATT, but the call‐
              ing process does not have read permission on the  message  queue
              _m_s_q_i_d, and does not have the CCAAPP__IIPPCC__OOWWNNEERR capability.

       EEFFAAUULLTT The  argument  _c_m_d  has  the  value IIPPCC__SSEETT or IIPPCC__SSTTAATT, but the
              address pointed to by _b_u_f isn't accessible.

       EEIIDDRRMM  The message queue was removed.

       EEIINNVVAALL Invalid value for _c_m_d or _m_s_q_i_d.  Or: for a  MMSSGG__SSTTAATT  operation,
              the  index  value  specified  in _m_s_q_i_d referred to an array slot
              that is currently unused.

       EEPPEERRMM  The argument _c_m_d has the value  IIPPCC__SSEETT  or  IIPPCC__RRMMIIDD,  but  the
              effective  user ID of the calling process is not the creator (as
              found in _m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._c_u_i_d) or the owner (as found in  _m_s_g___p_e_r_m_._u_i_d)
              of  the message queue, and the process is not privileged (Linux:
              it does not have the CCAAPP__SSYYSS__AADDMMIINN capability).

CCOONNFFOORRMMIINNGG TTOO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NNOOTTEESS
       The inclusion of _<_s_y_s_/_t_y_p_e_s_._h_> and _<_s_y_s_/_i_p_c_._h_> isn't required on  Linux
       or by any version of POSIX.  However, some old implementations required
       the inclusion of these header files, and the SVID also documented their
       inclusion.   Applications  intended  to be portable to such old systems
       may need to include these header files.

       The IIPPCC__IINNFFOO, MMSSGG__SSTTAATT and MMSSGG__IINNFFOO operations are used by the  iippccss(1)
       program  to  provide information on allocated resources.  In the future
       these may modified or moved to a _/_p_r_o_c filesystem interface.

       Various fields in the _s_t_r_u_c_t _m_s_q_i_d___d_s were typed as _s_h_o_r_t  under  Linux
       2.2 and have become _l_o_n_g under Linux 2.4.  To take advantage of this, a
       recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice.  (The  kernel
       distinguishes old and new calls by an IIPPCC__6644 flag in _c_m_d.)
