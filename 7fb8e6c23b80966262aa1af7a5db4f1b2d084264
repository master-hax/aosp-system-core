      "message": "Hi David,\n\nRegarding the KeyMint RoT issue on cuttlefish, I would like to add a new binary to set the required data. Since anyway we don\u0027t have a valid DICE chain in VM on cuttlefish, it doesn\u0027t matter much if the RoT is also fake.\n\nThere are no changes on the existing host binary.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "The non-secure version is only intended to be used for emulators. The goal is to send a RoT to unblock the boot flow, facilitating a proper development flow on emulators for the TA to pKVM project.\n\n\u003e  is this just a temporary change for getting things working, that\u0027s going to be removed later ...\n\nI don\u0027t think the fake data insertion either in host or in TA can be removed, as long as we want to keep the KM VM running on emulators for faster development iteration.\n\n\u003e replaced with a better way? \n\nI\u0027m certainly open to a more optimal approach. What are your suggestions on this?",
