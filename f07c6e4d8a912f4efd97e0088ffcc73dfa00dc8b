If factory image, for example, 1.7GB there will be only 300MB physical space left for logical partition served as a backing storage, while cache has 1.5GB.\n\n2. Please check my answer for David\u0027s comment\n\nWhile answering your questions, I realize that non-A/B device may be configured to store OTA package in the /data dir, while having small /cache. @dvander@google.com @yochiang@google.com If you agree with the general idea I am talking about, what do you think if I do ```if (!IsABDevice() \u0026\u0026 GetBoolProperty(kPreferCacheBackingStorageProp, false))``` in this patchset?",

So /cache is almost always large enough to be overlay for the most of super\u0027s data.",

For example, there may be a scenario (at least for us it happens almost everyday :)) when QA gives problematic device to research a problem, you rebuild some component with increased verbosity or possible fix, and don\u0027t have enough space in /data or super backing storage to push the artifacts. The proposed solution with property makes it possible to define it in factory build and always use big and free /cache partition without worrying. :)\n\n\u003e non-AB will fail VTS for Android 13+ launches (and soon, other xTS as well).\n\nOh... but what about reference boards like \u0027yukawa\u0027?
