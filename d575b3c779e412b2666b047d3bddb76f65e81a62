      "message": "My first implementation, I used chromeos::ProcessImpl to run the command.  However the code wound up being messier than I liked.  The issue wound up being, calling process.Run() blocks here until the process finishes.  Calling process.Start() instead allows it to not block, however if nothing calls process.Wait(), once crash_reporter finishes running it quits the process without it finishing, which in practice happens before dbus-send can actually send the signal.  The way around that, then would be to store the process in the class and call process.Wait() at the very end of execution... however the way the different collectors calls are structured, this CountUserCrash function is stored as a function pointer and called in several different locations based on the collector.  Modifying each collector to handle that independently from each other was much messier and harder to follow/read, than using vfork+execve which is all self-contained.",

      "message": "No, I\u0027m not explicitly wait()ing here.  But in my testing (I replaced the dbus-send call with `wait 10`), after the vfork+execve, the rest of crash_reporter finished running immediately, then waited until the child finished before exiting.\n\nI used vfork instead of regular fork to guarantee not having to copy all the excess process data that would just be wiped out during the execve.  I believe (but am not entirely sure) that it also ties into the previous quesion about wait()ing.  A vfork suspends the parent until either an _exit or successful execve call is made.  Once the execve call is successful it wakes back up the parent as it won\u0027t have resource contention anymore.  A fork call does not suspend the parent, and I believe then would require a wait() call to reap the child process.  If you feel strongly about using fork instead of vfork, and are sure that we\u0027ll always have a copy-on-write version of fork, I can switch it.",

Where is that waiting-before-exiting happening?\n\nIs dbus-send getting reparented to init?\n\nAs for fork vs vfork, this is the manpage:\n\n\"Under Linux, fork(2) is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty incurred by fork(2) is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent\u0027s page tables,  and to create a unique task structure for the child.\"\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think you can avoid wait()ing on vfork. Even when your child process goes through execve(), you still need to reap it; if not, it will get reparented to init when you exit.",
