      "message": "Why in this case did the iterator type inheritance work, but in LogStatistics.h it did not?\n\nAnother feature that did not get inherited was operator[] in LogStatistics.h; it complained (when I tried to use it) that it could not do it trivially so it was deleted from the inheritance. I suspect that is my _clue_. The difference is here we retain a pointer in the value easy to copy, but in LogStatistics the value is a class with non-trivial non-default copy constructors and all to complicate things.",
