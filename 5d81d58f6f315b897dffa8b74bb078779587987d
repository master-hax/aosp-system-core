      "message": "I think we need IOSQE_ASYNC. That will ensure that the I/O requests are offloaded to the kernel and user-space can come back and poll for I/O completion. Without that, there is no guarantee that I/O will be queued. It might happen inline.\n\nTo step back, there is some history why asynchornous calls are need to usb_ffs - http://b/37916658 - and the discussion goes back here: https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb@vger.kernel.org/msg90170.html\n\nI have a similar issue with adbd - https://r.android.com/c/2180697/1 - It works most of the time on Pixel devices; but I see occasional failures wherein I/O fails EIO - I haven\u0027t spent time digging into the failure path; but I suspect it has to do with queueing. Since fastboot is also using the same usb_ffs layer, i suspect fastboot might have similar issues.\n\nThe primary reason doing asynchronous calls for usb_ffs layer was memory allocation issues. Instead of using a single large buffer, with async calls, we can queue up small sized buffers to usb layers which is efficient and can subsquently poll for completion.\n\nEnh - Please correct me if I am wrong here - I understand the original change was done quite a while back. Any inputs here would be much appreciated.",
